Hi Charlotte,

I hope you’re doing well, and thank you once again for the warm welcome!

As per your instructions, I’m sharing my three statements for the “Two Truths and a Lie” game. Here they are:
	1.	I’ve boarded an airplane twice, but on both occasions, the plane never left the ground.
	2.	I wear a ring on my ring finger—it’s a habit I picked up after getting engaged.
	3.	Once, a photo of me talking to two street robbers went viral on social media.

Looking forward to meeting everyone in the upcoming session!

Best regards,
Aman
